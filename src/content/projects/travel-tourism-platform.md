## Overview

Led the development of a scalable, multi-tenant travel and tourism platform designed to deliver customized booking and itinerary experiences using modern web technologies and cloud infrastructure.

## Role: Senior Lead / Architect

As the technical lead and architect, I was responsible for designing the overall system architecture, establishing development standards, and leading the engineering team through implementation.

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **Next.js** with server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG)
- **NX Monorepo** structure for managing multiple tenant applications
- **React** and **TypeScript** for type-safe component development
- **Tailwind CSS** and **Material-UI** for consistent, responsive design
- **GraphQL** for efficient data fetching and state management

### Backend & Infrastructure
- **Sitecore CMS** for content management and personalization
- **AWS Services**:
  - Amplify for hosting and CI/CD
  - S3 for asset storage
  - CloudFront for content delivery
  - CloudWatch for monitoring and logging
- **Node.js** backend services

## Key Features

- Multi-tenant architecture supporting multiple brands from a single codebase
- Customized booking flows with dynamic itinerary building
- Real-time availability and pricing integration
- Personalized content delivery based on user preferences
- Responsive design optimized for all devices
- SEO-optimized with structured data and metadata management

## Technical Highlights

- Implemented monorepo architecture using NX for code sharing and efficient builds
- Designed reusable component library shared across tenant applications
- Set up comprehensive CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions
- Implemented performance optimization strategies achieving excellent Core Web Vitals scores
- Established accessibility standards (WCAG) compliance across all applications
- Integrated analytics and tracking using Google Tag Manager and Google Analytics

## Challenges Solved

- **Scalability**: Designed architecture to support multiple tenants without code duplication
- **Performance**: Optimized bundle sizes and implemented efficient code splitting
- **Maintainability**: Established clear separation of concerns and reusable abstractions
- **SEO**: Implemented server-side rendering and structured data for search visibility

## Impact

- Successfully launched platform serving multiple travel brands
- Reduced development time for new tenant onboarding by 70%
- Achieved 95+ Lighthouse scores across all performance metrics
- Established scalable infrastructure supporting future growth
